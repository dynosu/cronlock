# cronlock
bash script to prevent double running of crons under linux

This is the initial script. Not using it anywhere yet since its not 100% done yet. 

Flock can do most of this, but its not easy to monitor and therefor not amazing to use. 

## Issues

If you see a problem with the script or if you see something i could improve. Then please create an issue and ill look into it. 

## planned features

* merging of check script and cronlock script. (a monitoring/icinga mode of the script to check on status of a cron)
* examples of apply rules for icinga2 
* improving the code somewhat. 

## Otherwise

Feel free to use the script, however a thank you or acknowledgement would be nice.
