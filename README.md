# cronlock
bash script to prevent double running of crons under linux

This is the initial script. Not using it anywhere yet since its not 100% done yet. 

Flock can do most of this, but its not easy to monitor and therefor not amazing to use. 

planned features: 

* merging of check script and cronlock script. (a monitoring/icinga mode of the script to check on status of a cron)
* examples of apply rules for icinga2 
* improving the code somewhat.
